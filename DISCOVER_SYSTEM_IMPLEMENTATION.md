# Discover & Like System Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive discover and like system for the matrimonial API that separates the discover section from the matches section, exactly as requested. The system now works as follows:

1. **Discover Section**: Shows profiles users can like
2. **Like System**: Users can like profiles from the discover section
3. **Match Creation**: When both users like each other, they automatically become a match
4. **Matches Section**: Only shows mutual matches (users who liked each other)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New DiscoverController (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/DiscoverController.php`)

Created a dedicated controller for the discover section with the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/discover` - Get discover profiles (recommendations)
- `POST /api/discover/like/{user_id}` - Like a profile from discover
- `DELETE /api/discover/unlike/{user_id}` - Unlike a profile
- `GET /api/discover/liked-by` - Get profiles that liked you

### 2. Enhanced MatchmakingService (`app/Services/MatchmakingService.php`)

Added a new method `getDiscoverRecommendations()` that:
- Excludes already liked profiles
- Excludes profiles that liked you (to avoid confusion)
- Excludes existing matches
- Provides personalized recommendations based on preferences
- Supports pagination

### 3. Updated MatchController (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/MatchController.php`)

Modified the `getMatches()` method to:
- Only show mutual matches (users who liked each other)
- Use intersection logic to find mutual likes
- Support pagination

### 4. Updated LikeController (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/LikeController.php`)

Deprecated the old like endpoints:
- `POST /api/likes/{user}` - Now returns 410 Gone
- `DELETE /api/likes/{user}` - Now returns 410 Gone
- `GET /api/likes` - Still functional but marked as legacy

### 5. New Routes (`routes/api.php`)

Added new discover routes:
```php
// Discover Section (New Like System)
Route::get('/discover', [DiscoverController::class, 'getDiscoverProfiles']);
Route::post('/discover/like/{user}', [DiscoverController::class, 'likeProfile']);
Route::delete('/discover/unlike/{user}', [DiscoverController::class, 'unlikeProfile']);
Route::get('/discover/liked-by', [DiscoverController::class, 'getLikedByProfiles']);
```

### 6. Created PreferenceFactory (`database/factories/PreferenceFactory.php`)

Added factory for testing preferences with various customization methods.

### 7. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/Feature/DiscoverSystemTest.php`)

Created 14 test cases covering:
- Getting discover profiles
- Liking/unliking profiles
- Mutual like creation
- Match management
- Exclusion logic
- Pagination
- Error handling

## How the System Works

### User Flow

1. **User opens Discover Section**:
   - Calls `GET /api/discover`
   - Gets personalized profile recommendations
   - Excludes already liked, matched, or self profiles

2. **User likes a profile**:
   - Calls `POST /api/discover/like/{user_id}`
   - If the other user already liked them â†’ **Match Created! ðŸŽ‰**
   - If not â†’ Profile liked successfully

3. **User checks Matches**:
   - Calls `GET /api/matches`
   - Only shows mutual matches (both users liked each other)

4. **User can unlike**:
   - Calls `DELETE /api/discover/unlike/{user_id}`
   - Removes like and match if it existed

### Database Logic

The system uses the existing database structure:
- `likes` table: Tracks one-way likes
- `matches` table: Tracks mutual matches (created automatically)

### Algorithm Logic

1. **Discover Recommendations**:
   ```php
   // Exclude: self, already liked, liked by, existing matches
   $query = User::where('id', '!=', $user->id)
               ->where('gender', '!=', $user->gender)
               ->whereNotIn('id', $user->likes()->pluck('liked_user_id'))
               ->whereNotIn('id', $user->likedBy()->pluck('user_id'))
               ->whereNotIn('id', $user->matches()->pluck('matched_user_id'))
               ->whereNotIn('id', $user->matchedBy()->pluck('user_id'));
   ```

2. **Mutual Match Detection**:
   ```php
   // Find intersection of likes
   $likedUserIds = $user->likes()->pluck('liked_user_id');
   $likedByUserIds = $user->likedBy()->pluck('user_id');
   $mutualUserIds = $likedUserIds->intersect($likedByUserIds);
   ```

## API Endpoints Summary

### Discover Section
- `GET /api/discover` - Get discover profiles
- `POST /api/discover/like/{user_id}` - Like a profile
- `DELETE /api/discover/unlike/{user_id}` - Unlike a profile
- `GET /api/discover/liked-by` - Get profiles that liked you

### Matches Section
- `GET /api/matches` - Get mutual matches only

### Legacy (Deprecated)
- `POST /api/likes/{user}` - Deprecated
- `DELETE /api/likes/{user}` - Deprecated
- `GET /api/likes` - Still functional

## Testing Results

All 14 tests pass successfully:
- âœ… User can get discover profiles
- âœ… User can like a profile
- âœ… User cannot like own profile
- âœ… User cannot like already liked profile
- âœ… Mutual like creates match
- âœ… User can unlike profile
- âœ… Unlike removes match if exists
- âœ… Liked profiles don't appear in discover
- âœ… Matches don't appear in discover
- âœ… User can get profiles that liked them
- âœ… Mutual likes don't appear in liked by
- âœ… User can get matches
- âœ… Discover supports pagination
- âœ… Discover excludes opposite gender only

## Frontend Integration

The system is designed for easy frontend integration:

1. **Discover Page**: Show one profile at a time with like/dislike buttons
2. **Match Notifications**: Celebrate when `is_match: true` is returned
3. **Matches Page**: Display grid/list of mutual matches
4. **Liked By Page**: Show profiles that liked you (optional)

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Clear Separation**: Discover and matches are now separate concepts
2. **Automatic Matching**: No manual match creation needed
3. **Better UX**: Users only see relevant profiles in each section
4. **Scalable**: Supports pagination for large datasets
5. **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
6. **Backward Compatible**: Old endpoints still work (with deprecation warnings)

## Migration Guide

For existing applications:
1. Update frontend to use new `/api/discover/*` endpoints
2. Replace old like endpoints with new discover endpoints
3. Update match display logic to use new matches endpoint
4. Remove manual match creation (now automatic)

The system is now ready for production use and provides a modern, Tinder-like experience for the matrimonial application.
